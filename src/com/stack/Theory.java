/*
 * The Stack is a linear data structure, which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
The LIFO order says that the element which is inserted at the last in the Stack will be the first one to be removed. In LIFO order, the insertion takes place at the rear end of the stack and deletion occurs at the front of the stack.
The FILO order says that the element which is inserted at the first in the Stack will be the last one to be removed. In FILO order, the insertion takes place at the rear end of the stack and deletion occurs at the front of the stack.

Mainly, the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:
Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they were pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack.

isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.

	 * The class can also be said to extend Vector and treats the class as a stack with the five mentioned 
	 * functions. The class can also be referred to as the subclass of Vector. The class supports 
	 * one default constructor Stack() which is used to create an empty stack.
