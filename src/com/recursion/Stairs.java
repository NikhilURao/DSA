/**
 * Count ways to reach the n’th stair
There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. 
The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, 
the person can reach the top.

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
There is only one way to climb 1 stair

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
There are two ways: (1, 1) and (2)

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 2)
