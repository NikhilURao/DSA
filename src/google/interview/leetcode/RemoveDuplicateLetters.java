Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(N)O(N). Although there is a loop inside a loop, the time complexity is still O(N)O(N). This is because the inner while loop is bounded by the total number of elements added to the stack (each time it fires an element goes). This means that the total amount of time spent in the inner loop is bounded by O(N)O(N), giving us a total time complexity of O(N)O(N)

Space complexity : O(1)O(1). At first glance it looks like this is O(N)O(N), but that is not true! seen will only contain unique elements, so it's bounded by the number of characters in the alphabet (a constant). You can only add to stack if an element has not been seen, so stack also only consists of unique elements. This means that both stack and seen are bounded by constant, giving us O(1)O(1) space complexity.
